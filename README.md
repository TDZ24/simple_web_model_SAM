# Project Title: Unfinished Experiment - Segment Anything Simple Web Model
This project, "Unfinished Experiment - Segment Anything Simple Web Model," was part of a series of trials but could not be formally completed. The objective was to implement the "segment-anything" functionality using a simple web model. This implementation was based on ongoing research by the project "segment-anything." The project involved tests conducted using Jupyter Notebooks within Visual Studio Code as well as JavaScript.

The "segment-anything" project aimed to develop a simple web model capable of accurately segmenting various objects and elements within images. The objective was to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading images and displaying corresponding masks for segmented objects. Although this project remains unfinished, it showed promising potential when executed through web-based environments.

This project holds special relevance in the field of medicine, where image segmentation techniques play a crucial role. By accurately segmenting objects within medical images, this project has the potential to aid in medical diagnoses, treatment planning, and research activities.
